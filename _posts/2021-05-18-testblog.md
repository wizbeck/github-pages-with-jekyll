This is a test blog page to practice using GitHub pages and uploading a blog using markdown text to my github pages. This also helps me to understand and practice the flow of common github branching, commiting, doing pull requests. and merging the branch with the main branch.
Good Practice learning how to do this and get in the habit of the GitHub flow.
